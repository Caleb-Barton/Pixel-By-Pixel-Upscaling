Today is the first day I am working on the project!

I'm very excited about it, but I am also worried that my strategy just won't work at all! So I will try to keep ahead of schedule in case I run into significant difficulties.

Today I found the images that will eventually be the training data. I found them all on FreePik.com, except one that is just a bunch of icons that I threw together in PowerPoint.
